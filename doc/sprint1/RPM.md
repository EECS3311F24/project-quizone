Reason for only working on these stories for sprint 1:  The chosen user stories (quiz creation, customization, feedback, flagging, retakes, and history) form the essential functionality of the platform. Without these, the app lacks a basic quiz experience, so itâ€™s crucial to get these core features right before expanding.
