Reason for only working on these stories for sprint 1:  The chosen user stories (quiz creation, customization, feedback, flagging, and history) form the essential functionality of the platform. Without these, the app lacks a basic quiz experience, so itâ€™s crucial to get these core features right before expanding.

Release Goals of this Sprint Based on User Stories:
Goal: Deliver a functional quiz experience focused on creation, customization, and immediate feedback. This sprint will allow users (quiz enthusiasts and students) to create and take quizzes with personalized options and get instant feedback to support learning and review.
