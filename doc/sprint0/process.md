Process
• Team organization:
Throughout our meetings, we reviewed the requirements for Sprint 0 and assigned tasks based on each team member’s expertise and personal interests, particularly drawing from our past projects. This allowed each of us to take on tasks we felt confident handling while ensuring an even distribution of work.
• Tools used:
To manage our project, we utilized several tools:

1. GitHub: This was our primary version control tool, where we submit and update code for the project.
2. Trello: We use Trello to organize our user stories and track progress. Each user story was assigned to a team member, and the board was updated regularly as tasks were completed.
3. Discord, WhatsApp, Zoom: These tools were critical for communication. We used Discord for daily stand-ups, WhatsApp for quick messages and updates, and Zoom for our formal meetings.
   • User story points:
   We have created 20 user stories so far, each representing a core feature of the project. . We followed the Agile methodology for creating user stories. Some stories required additional rounds of discussion to finalize their points, particularly where tasks were interconnected.
   • Meeting frequency:
   We met twice a week via Zoom to discuss progress, address blockers, and reassign tasks if necessary. In addition to these formal meetings, we held daily asynchronous check-ins on Discord and WhatsApp to ensure everyone stayed aligned. This frequent communication allowed us to stay on top of tasks and address any issues early.
   • Lessons learned:
   Sprint 0 provided us with several valuable lessons. One key takeaway was the importance of early communication when setting up the project. Clear expectations regarding tool usage (especially Trello) helped us stay organized. We also learned that our decision-making process, while effective, could be improved by ensuring all voices are heard more consistently. Moving into Sprint 1, we aim to improve our documentation practices and make quicker decisions during meetings to streamline the workflow.
