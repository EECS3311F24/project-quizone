Project Name:
QuiZone- A Custom Flashcard Quiz App Made for Tech Students

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a quiz app that helps tech students, particularly those studying computer science (CS) and preparing for technical interviews,
to create custom flashcards. Unlike platforms like LeetCode or NeetCode which offer pre-made solutions, our app encourages users to write their own questions, 
answers, and hints. The app focuses on interactive learning, allowing users to personalize their study material.


Key Objectives:
* Empower users to create custom flashcards: The core feature is the ability for users to generate their own flashcards with questions, hints, and solutions, tailored to their unique learning path.
* Focus on tech subjects: Unlike general-purpose flashcard apps, our platform focuses on computer science topics, particularly LeetCode-style questions, algorithms, and data structures.
* Facilitate active learning: By not providing pre-made solutions, the app motivates users to actively engage in learning through the creation of their own study materials, fostering deeper understanding.

Key Users
* Tech Students - Primarily undergraduates or bootcamp attendees preparing for technical interviews or exams in CS subjects.
* Self-learners in Programming - People who are learning coding independently and prefer building their own custom flashcards to support their study efforts.
* Coding Interview Candidates- Individuals focused on practicing coding challenges for interviews who need a structured, customizable way to review topics.

Key Use Cases:
* Creating Custom Flashcards- Users can create flashcards with personalized questions, coding challenges, hints, and solutions, organizing them into decks for specific subjects (e.g., data structures, algorithms, system design).
* Tracking Progress- Users can track their progress as they review their custom decks, marking cards as "learned," "review," or "difficult," which can be revisited later based on their performance.
* Sharing Decks with Peers- Users can share their custom flashcard decks with fellow students, creating a collaborative environment for learning and problem-solving.

Key Usage Scenarios:
* Coding Interview Prep- A user preparing for a technical interview creates a deck of flashcards with coding problems similar to those on LeetCode. They write their own solutions and hints to review before the interview.
* Studying for a CS Exam- Students create flashcards covering data structures and algorithms, using the app to quiz themselves before their final exam.
* Collaborative Learning- A group of students working on coding projects share their flashcard decks with each other to collaboratively review key concepts and coding challenges.

Tone and Key Message:
Tone- Encouraging and focused on active learning and customization. The app should feel like a personalized study companion.
Key Message- Empower tech students and coding interview candidates to take control of their learning through the creation of personalized flashcards that deepen their understanding of coding concepts and problems.
