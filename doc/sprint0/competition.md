Introduction: Our quiz app, QuiZone, is tailored for tech students, focusing on self-created flashcards for LeetCode questions and CS classes. Unlike platforms like NeetCode and LeetCode, which provide solutions, your app empowers users to build their own problem sets and solutions. Here's how your app compares:

Existing Products:

* Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/): A customizable flashcard app where users can create decks for any topic. However, it lacks focus on coding problems or CS-specific tools.
* Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/): Another app for creating custom flashcards, but it’s not tailored for tech students and lacks interactive coding features.
* LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/): Focuses on solving pre-made coding problems with solutions and discussions. While it offers a rich problem bank, users cannot create their own flashcards.
* NeetCode (https://neetcode.io/): Provides curated coding questions with solutions for interview prep but does not allow user-generated content.

How is Your Product Different?

* Custom Flashcards for Coding: Our app lets users create their own flashcards, allowing them to write coding questions, hints, and answers in their own words, which can help deepen understanding.
* No Pre-Made Solutions: Instead of offering fixed solutions, your app focuses on user-driven learning, where students can create and share their own problems and solutions, encouraging active engagement.
* Tech-Specific Features: Your app includes features that support tech subjects, such as embedding code snippets or adding interactive problem elements.

Target Users and Scenarios:

* Users: Tech students preparing for coding interviews, CS classes, and people who want a deeper understanding of programming topics.
* Scenarios: Students who prefer creating their own practice material and explanations, or those who want to customize their learning path by focusing on specific problems and concepts they struggle with.

Why Competitors Didn’t Focus on These Users:

* Lack of Focus on Self-Generated Content: Competitors like LeetCode and NeetCode focus on providing a fixed set of problems and solutions, leaving little room for users to contribute their own content.
* Effort to Shift: For competitors to refocus, they would need to introduce robust tools for user-generated content, which may require significant development in features like collaborative flashcards, code snippet support, and content moderation. Also, they are aiming for a bigger user base.
