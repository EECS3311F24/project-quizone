• Code completion:
The code for each feature should be fully implemented according to the specifications outlined in the relevant user story. The implementation must cover all acceptance criteria defined in the user story.

• Code review:
All code changes must go through a peer review by at least one team member before being merged into the main branch. The review should ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and alignment with the project’s overall architecture.

• Integration:
The feature must be smoothly integrated with the rest of the system. This means that the feature should not cause conflicts, errors, or performance issues when merged into the main codebase. It should work seamlessly within the project’s existing architecture.

• Documentation:
Each feature should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. This includes clear inline comments where necessary, updates to any relevant README files, and any additional documentation required for understanding or using the feature.

• Version control:
The code for each feature must be committed and pushed to the team’s GitHub repository with a descriptive and meaningful commit message. This ensures traceability and helps team members follow the development progress.

• User acceptance:
